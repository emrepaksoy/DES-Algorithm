# DES-Algorithm
Data encryption standard (DES) algorithm implementation in Python.

* DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a block cipher that encrypts in blocks of 64 bits. For a 64-bit input block, a 64-bit output block is obtained.
* DES is a symmetric algorithm. That means the same key is used for encryption and decryption.
* The algorithm is a combination of two techniques. These are referred to as confusion and diffusion. The application of a simple combination of these techniques on a block is called a round. DES has 16 loops.
* Daha açık bir ifadeyle, açık metnin bir bloğu üzerinde bu iki teknik 16 defa uygulanır.
